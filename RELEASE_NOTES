 COMP SUPERSCALAR FRAMEWORK
-----------------------------

COMP Superscalar (COMPSs) is a programming model which aims to ease the development of applications for distributed infrastructures,
such as Clusters, Grids and Clouds. COMP superscalar also features a runtime system that exploits the inherent parallelism of 
applications at execution time.


Release number: 2.3 Daisy
Release date: June-2018
-------------------------------
New features:
        * Runtime:
                - Persistent storage interface implementation with Redis back-end
                - Support for FPGA constraints and reprogram scripts
                - Support for PBS queue system and the Archer Supercomputer
                - Support for binding objects (no file serialization)
                - Support for deregister objects in order to reduce application memory usage

        * Python:
                - Support for Python 3
                - Support for python environments
                - Support for running pyCOMPSs as python module
                - Support for functions as parameters
                - Tasks returning multiple elements (returns=#)

        * C:
                - Persistent worker with Memory-to-memory transfers
                - Support for arrays (no serialization required)

Improvements:
        - Source Code and example applications distribution on Github
        - Automatic inference of task return
        - Improved obsolete object cleanup.
        - Improved tracing support for persistent object applications
        - Improved finalization process to reduce zombie processes
        - Several bug fixes

Known Limitations:
        - Tasks that invoke Numpy and MKL may experience issues if tasks use a different number of MKL threads. This is due to
          the fact that MKL reuses threads in the different calls and it does not change the number of threads from one call to another.
